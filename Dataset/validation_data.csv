Spend your money elsewhere.,0
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!,1
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,0
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!",0
-My order was not correct.,0
"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.",0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
We won't be returning.,0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,1
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,0
"Very, very sad.",0
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?",0
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!",0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.,0
"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better",0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.,0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!,0
"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.",0
"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.",0
This place is disgusting!,0
"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.",1
The RI style calamari was a joke.,0
"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.",0
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.",0
"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.",0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,0
Disappointing experience.,0
"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.",0
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",0
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,0
We won't be going back.,0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,0
This place lacked style!!,0
"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.",0
Don't bother coming here.,0
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.",0
"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.",0
It was equally awful.,0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,0
very slow at seating even with reservation.,0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,0
"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.",0
"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.",0
I was VERY disappointed!!,0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,0
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.",0
